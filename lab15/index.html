		<h1>Lab 15: AJAX</h1>
		
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>Working with your partner, experiment with jQuery and AJAX.</p>
		
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>
			I had a lot of problems looking for an api to use. A lot of them
			limited request rates, costed money, or had CORS security issues.
			Secondly, I had issues with my functions running all at the same
			time instead of one after another, so my api get call was finishing 
			faster than my function used to get the input and modify the 
			apiEndpoint link. To fix this I made them seperate functions and 
			rewrote my button event handler to force functions execute in the
			correct order.
