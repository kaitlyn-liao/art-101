	<h1>Lab 3 - File Structures and File Transfer</h1>
	<h2>About this Lab</h2>
	<p>The goal of this lab is to create a local file structure on your computer,
		add index.html files, and upload to the server.
	</p>
	<h2>Difficulties</h2>
	<p>The main difficulties with this lab was getting the images to show up on the
		index page. I kept misspelling the names of the images and forgetting to add
		the '.png' when img source.
	</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>These are the progress screenshots of my work for Lab 3.</p>
