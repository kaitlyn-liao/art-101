	<h1>Lab 3 - File Structures and File Transfer</h1>
	<h2>About this Lab</h2>
	<p>
		The goal is to get in the habit of thinking in terms 
		of pseudocoding before jumping into coding.
	</p>

		// computer score starts at 0 points 
		// loop until the player or computer scores 5 points
		//     save players choice
		//     randomly pick rock paper scissors and save as computer choice
		//     compare player and computer choice
		//     assign point to winner 
		//     print updated score

		// Organize To-Do List 
		// accept list of tasks and their due dates
		// create a new empty list to store reorganized list 
		// remove the first task in user inputted list and put it in our new list
		// loop through the elements of the new list 
		//     check if the current element's due date is before or at the same time as the first element in user list
		//         remove first element of user list and insert it at our current position in the new list 
		//     if we have reached the end of the new list
